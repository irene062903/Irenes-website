    But did you know the <strong>history</strong> behind it?? It has taken thousands of volcanic eruptions for the island to be formed. In the last 400.000 years, the Santorini volcano had erupted over 100 times. Due to its volcanic nature, you can enjoy spending time on multi-colored beaches during your holidays. There are the famous Red Beach, and also black and white beaches!

    <p> I also need to go to portugual, only in the spring though, because it is very humid in the summer, highest temprature reached 44 degrees this year!! Despite that, it is very breathtaking as well!
